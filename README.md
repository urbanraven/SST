Simple Stock Ticker

## Purpose
To provide a basic stock ticker for macOS. This has likely been done a zillion times, but I figured it'd make a good project. The goal is basically a single line marquee type ticker that docks near the bottom of the screen.

## Language
Swift

## To Do
Uhm... everything?
1. Working ticker
2. Allow choice of what to follow on the ticker
3. Convince wife to use a Mac
